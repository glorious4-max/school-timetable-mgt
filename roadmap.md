🗂️ Project Overview
This project is a React-based frontend for a school timetable management system. It allows an administrator to manage users, teachers, classes, and timetables. The backend is already implemented using Express.js and PostgreSQL.

The frontend will be built using Vite, React, and will integrate with the backend via REST APIs.

✅ Phase 1: Project Initialization & Setup
Tasks:
 Create the project using Vite with React + TypeScript template

 Install and configure TailwindCSS

 Install and configure React Router DOM

 Install Axios for HTTP requests

 Set up a clean folder structure:

css
Copy
Edit
src/
  ├── api/
  ├── components/
  ├── pages/
  ├── layouts/
  ├── context/
  ├── utils/
  └── main.tsx
 Create a .env file for backend URL (e.g. VITE_API_BASE_URL)

✅ Phase 2: Authentication (Login Page)
Tasks:
 Create a LoginPage component

 Create a simple login form (username & password)

 On submit, call POST /login endpoint

 Store token and user info in context or localStorage

 Redirect to dashboard on success

 Create an AuthContext and PrivateRoute for protected routes

✅ Phase 3: Dashboard Page
Tasks:
 Create DashboardPage component

 Call GET /api/stats on page load

 Display summary cards:

Teacher Count

Class Count

Unique Subjects

Timetable Entries

 Add navigation links to other sections (Teachers, Classes, Timetable)

✅ Phase 4: Teacher Management
Tasks:
 Create TeachersPage to list all teachers

 Use GET /api/teachers to fetch data

 Add modal or separate page for:

Create (POST /api/teachers)

Edit (PUT /api/teachers/:id)

View details (GET /api/teachers/:id)

Delete (DELETE /api/teachers/:id)

 Display assigned classes count per teacher

✅ Phase 5: Class Management
Tasks:
 Create ClassesPage to list all classes

 Use GET /api/classes to fetch data

 Add modal or separate page for:

✅ Phase 7: UI & UX Improvements
Tasks:
 Add responsive layout with sidebar navigation

 Add loading states and error messages

 Use modals for create/edit operations

 Add notifications for success/errors (e.g., with Toast)

✅ Phase 8: Final Integration & Testing
Tasks:
 Test all API integrations

 Confirm role-based behavior (e.g., only admin access)

 Validate all inputs in forms

 Final code cleanup and refactoring

✅ Phase 9: Deployment (Optional)
Tasks:
 Build frontend (vite build)

 Deploy using a platform like Netlify, Vercel, or your own server
